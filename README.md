## Challenges 💪
While Django has many convenient built-in features including a user model with authentication and class-based views that simplify routes, understanding what was taking place behind-the-scenes proved to be a challenge. Instead of explicitly being able to control each step of processing a request, it was vital for me to reference the Django documentation as well as the Object-Relational Mapper to ensure I was performing the response method I intended.  

## What's Next 🏁
Although Elevator is fully equipped to track down job applications for your next job search, its future is still very exciting. A few icebox goals for Elevator are to implement a component to store recruiting documents like resumes and cover letters, as well as a priority property to rank applications from most interested to least interested.

## Reflection 🙌
Building Elevator was a monumental feat in my growth as a software engineer. With only roughly a week's worth of Django knowledge, I envisioned and brought to life a full-stack application with Django's model view template (MVT) architecture. While integrating function views, class-based views, and authentication were challenging, I am proud of my resilience to power through obstacles by referencing Google, YouTube, and the Django documentation.
