As a job seeker, I want to...
- Keep my job applications organized by status and date
- Securely authenticate my account (sign up, log in, and logout)
- Browse applications by status (incomplete, applied, interviewed, offered, and rejected)
- Add, edit, and delete job applications
- Record important job application data (company, position, application link, location, date applied, and status)
- Use this application on any device
